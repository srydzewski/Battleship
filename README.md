# Battleship
In the fall of 2017, I took CS112 at Amherst College and made a battleship game with two other students for our final project. 
The instructions were to create a program using what we've learned in the class (i.e. classes, lists, inheritance, etc) and graphics.

To compile: In terminal type javac *.java
To run: In terminal type java StartGame

Directions: There are 5 boats with lengths 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1. Once you start the game, choose a level and press start game.
Then the opponent's grid will appear and you need to shoot that grid by clicking a spot.
Then click the space bar which will show your boats and where the computer shot. Click the space bar again to change grids and take another shot.
Note: The space bar will cause the opponent to take its turn, if you click the space bar multiple times without clicking a square you will lose at least one turn.
A red dot means a shot and a green dot means a hit. When you've sunk a boat, the boat will appear on the grid.
When the game is over, the game over screen will display and close the window to start a new game.
You can play multiple games at once if you desire.
